You should read the entire assignment handout before starting the assignment.  Start early, this assignment is considerably more work than any of the exercises. </p>A description of the game of Mastermind is below.  I encourage you to try playing the game <a href="http://www.archimedes-lab.org/mastermind.html">here</a> several times until you feel very familiar with it and comfortable.</p><h2> Mastermind Rules</h2><p>This is a two person game.  One person creates a hidden colour combination or code - consisting of 4 colour pegs chosen from 6 colours.  The colours may be repeated. For example, the code might be Blue, Red, Red, Yellow.  Your program will play the role of the first person and create a hidden code.</p><p>The other player (the user) is the code-breaker and tries to figure out the code.  He or she does this by guessing the code.  The first player (ie, your program) gives feedback on the correctness of the guess by telling the second player how many <strong>correctly positioned</strong> colour pegs the guess has and how many correct colour but <strong>incorrectly positioned</strong> pegs the guess has.  This feedback is in the form of a white peg for a correct colour but incorrect position and black peg for a correctly positioned colour. See the <a href="http://www.archimedes-lab.org/mastermind.html">online game</a>.  The game usually goes for a maximum of 10 tries before the guesser either wins or looses.<p><p>In our version of the game, we will use 6 colours, code length 4 and maximum of 10 guesses.  These are set as constants. Constants (fixed values) are variables whose values do not change once assigned. A different naming convention (uppercase pothole) is used for constants so that programmers know to not change their values. The constants <code>VALID_CHARS</code>, <code>SIZE</code> and <code>TRIES</code> in the starter file <a href="game.py">game.py</a> have been set for you.  These constants must remain unchanged. </p><p>In 1977, the mathematician Donald Knuth demonstrated that the code-breaker can solve the pattern in five moves or less, using an algorithm that progressively reduced the number of possible patterns. Can you figure out the algorithm?</p><h2>Mastermind Game Functions</h2><p>In this part you will write the functions that do most of the work in your game of Mastermind.You will write these functions in a file called <code>mastermind.py</code>.  Make sure you really understand the rules of Mastermind as described above. <p>For each function name and description below, fill in the docstring and code for the Python function of the same name in the starter file <a href="mastermind.py"> mastermind.py</a>.  You will need to remove the Python command <code>pass</code> from the starter code function definitions.  Notice that now you are responsible for writing the docstring types, description and examples - please include at least two examples for each function except for <code>create_code</code> and <code>display_game</code>. You may find that some functions need more to fully check their correctness.  Remember that for assignments you will be graded on the quality of your docstrings.</p><table width=100% border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>	<COL width=100*>	<COL width=189*>	<tr>		<th width=45%>			<p>Function Name 			</p>		</th>		<th width=55%>			<p>Description 			</p>		</th>	</tr>	<tr>		<td width=45%>			<p><code>create_code(str, int)</code>			</p>		</td>		<td width=55%>			<p>Given a str and a size (an int) return a list of length size of single character strs comprised of the characters in the  given str.

The string should begin with the headers <code>Guess</code> and <code>Clues</code> separated by a tab and ended with a new line. The next line should consist of 16 <code>'*'</code> characters followed by a new line.  Next, each corresponding sublists of the given lists.  Each character in the sublists should be separated by spaces.  Each pair of sublists should be separated by a tab and on a separate line (see the sample output described in the game section for clarification).  Your function should work no matter what size the guesses are and no matter how many guesses there are.  Note that in order for the automarker to correctly accept your output you must follow these instructions exactly. For example, if the two lists were <code>[['Y', 'P', 'G', 'G'], ['O', 'O', 'G', 'G']]</code> and <code>[['b', 'b'], ['b','b', 'b', 'b']]</code> then the function would return <code>'''Guess\tClues\n****************\nY P G G\tb b\nO O G G\tb b b b\n'''<code>.        </td>	</tr>    </table><h2>The Game</h2><p>In this section you will write a main program that calls your functions to create the game.  ALL code for this section MUST be in the <code>if '__name__' == '__main__':</code> section of the <a href="game.py">game.py</a> starter file. In this section, your code will consist primarily of a <code>while</code> loop, interactions with the user and calls to functions from <code>mastermind.py</code>. </p>    <p> The program order is as follows:<ol><li><p>Create the secret colour code. Hint: use one of your functions to help you!</p></li>        <li><p>Get the user's first guess by asking the user to        <p><code>"Please enter your guess of length X using the letters Y:"</code></p><br>                where <code>X</code> is the size of the code size specified in the starter file and <code>Y</code> refers to the string <code>'GRBYOP'</code> (Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple) also specified in the starter file.<br></p>        </li>    <li><p>Check that the guess is valid (uses the correct characters and is the correct length).  If the guess is not valid, your program should ask for a new guess using the statement:        <p><code>"Please enter your guess again of length X using the letters Y:"</code></p><br>                where <code>X</code> is the size of the code size specified in the starter file and <code>Y</code> refers to the string <code>'GRBYOP'</code> (Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple) also specified in the starter file.<br>        </p>     <li><p>Determine the appropriate clue for the guess.  Keep track of all the guesses and clues along the way - this way you can display the state of the game.                  </p></li>    <li><p>Display the current state of the game including all guesses and clues. For example, after two guesses have been made, an output may look like:</p>       <p> <code>Guess &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Clues<br>       ****************<br>           O O O O  &nbsp	b<br>            R R R R  &nbsp b b<br></code>        </p>                <p>The formatting of your output must look exactly like that above with each letter separated by a space and a tab separating the guesses from the clues, one guess, clue pair per line.</p>        </li>        <li><p>The game ends when either the player reaches the maximum number of guesses or  the player guesses the code.  If the player reaches the maximum number of guesses without guessing the code the message:<p><code>"I'm sorry you lose. The correct code was Z."</code></p>where <code>Z</code> is the answer code.  If the player guesses the code correctly your program should output:<p><code>"Congratulations! It took you N guesses to find the code."</code></p>where <code>N</code> is the number of guesses used.</p></li>        </ul>    <h2>Marking</h2>    <p>      Here are some general outlines and explanatory notes:     </p>    <ul>      <li>        <p>          <b>Correctness:</b> your functions should perform as specified.          Correctness, as measured by our tests, will count for the          largest single portion of your marks.        </p>      </li>      <li>        <p>          <b>Style:</b> Make sure that you  test your code using the pep8 online code checker (see resources page).  It is           picky but you will know your style is good once it passes!        </p>      </li>            <li>        <p>          <b>Programming style:</b> Your variable names should be meaningful and your code as simple and clear as possible. You should avoid duplicate code by calling other functions within the module as helpers. You should use the constants rather than "magic" values (e.g., use <code>VALID_CHARS</code>, not <code>'GRYP'</code>). Your functions should be written so that they would work properly even if different values are used for the constants.      </p></li><li>        <p>          <b>Commenting</b>: for each function, you should write a          docstring comment that describes its parametres, what the          function does, and what is returned by the function as well as appropriate examples.        </p>      </li> <li>        <p>          <b>Reuse</b>: in each part, some of the functions that are          specified in the table can be written by calling other          functions in that table.  You should do this as much as          possible.  Whenever you find yourself writing duplicate code you should ask yourself whether that code would be better served in a separate function.        </p>      </li>    </ul><h3>Warning about Plagiarism</h3>A variation of this assignment was assigned several years ago. <font color='red'>To detect plagiarism, a software program will be used to compare all assignments submitted as well as assignments submitted in the past for similarity to detect plagiarism. </font> As always, the work that you submit must be your own and you must not share your work with others.<H2>What to Hand In</H2> <p> Submit your python files <code>game.py</code> and <code>mastermind.py</code> to <a href="http://markus.utsc.utoronto.ca/csca20f17/en">MarkUs</a>.
